# Privacy Policy for SiteBlocker Free Chrome Extension

Last Updated: 08th of May 2025

Thank you for using SiteBlocker Free ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Do Not Collect

SiteBlocker Free is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information, browsing history (other than the URLs you explicitly provide for blocking), or any other sensitive personal data.

## Information You Provide for Blocking

- **Websites to Block:** You provide specific website URLs that you wish to block.
- **Time Schedules:** You may provide start and end times for scheduled blocking.

## How This Information is Used and Stored

- **Local Storage:** All website URLs and time schedules you configure are stored exclusively locally on your computer using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API.
- **Purpose:** This information is used solely by the Extension to perform its core function: blocking access to the websites you have specified, according to the schedules you have set.
- **No External Transmission:** Your configured blocklist and schedules are NEVER transmitted to any external servers or third parties. All processing happens locally within your browser.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, its security is tied to the security of your computer and your Chrome browser profile.

## Data Removal

You can remove your configured data at any time by:

- Deleting individual rules within the Extension's options page.
- Uninstalling the SiteBlocker Free extension, which will remove all locally stored data associated with it.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the extension's store listing or options page.
